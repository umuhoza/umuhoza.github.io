# Copilot Instructions for Project

## Project Context

This is a **React.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** project scaffolded with **Vite**.  
The purpose is to design and implement a **professional-level, interactive, and user-accessible website** for a **Computer Science Research Professor Bio Website**.

## Design Philosophy

- **Pixel-Perfect Replication**: When images, mockups, or design references are provided, replicate them **exactly** with precise alignment, spacing, and typography.
- **Professional Grade**: Layout and styling should reflect academic professionalism while remaining clean, modern, and approachable.
- **Accessibility First**: Ensure all design choices align with accessibility standards (semantic HTML, ARIA where needed, contrast ratios, and responsive design).
- **Intuitive Interactions**: Add subtle, context-aware interactions that guide users naturally without being distracting.
- **Seamless Scrolling**: Implement smooth, natural scrolling transitions for an elegant user experience.
- **Subtle Animations**: Use animations only where they improve flow or highlight key elements. Animations should be minimal, smooth, and consistent with the academic tone.

## Development Goals

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes consistently for responsive and maintainable styling.
- Leverage **Framer Motion** (or CSS transitions) for subtle animations where appropriate.
- Implement **component reusability** and maintain a clear, modular code structure.
- Prioritize **fast load times** and optimized performance.
- Ensure the final product is **visually polished** and ready for public/academic presentation.

## Workflow Notes

- Copilot should always **think in terms of professional web design standards** (accessibility, responsiveness, performance).
- When I provide an **image or mockup**, Copilot should assume the goal is to **replicate it pixel-perfectly**.
- Where design gaps exist, Copilot should **propose intuitive enhancements** (micro-interactions, hover states, scroll effects, responsive adjustments).
- Code should be **clean, TypeScript-safe, and production-ready**.
